# Geothermal power plant - binary cycle

Geothermal power is electrical power generated from geothermal energy. Technologies in use include dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations.

Geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine thermal power stations in that heat from a fuel source (in geothermal's case, the Earth's core) is used to heat water or another working fluid. The working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator, thereby producing electricity. The fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source. @https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power.

Here is the next thread with a double flow binary cycle : [Geothermal power plant - single and double flow](https://github.com/AlexPhysics/PythonProjects/tree/main/Geothermal%20power%20plant%20-%20single%20and%20double%20flow).

The science behind it: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power).  
The problem: [atp_tp02_binarygeotherm.pdf](https://github.com/AlexPhysics/PythonProjects/blob/main/Geothermal%20power%20plant%20-%20binary%20cycle/atp_tp02_binarygeotherm.pdf).  
The solution - efficiency, CO2 mass flow rate and power calculation: [cycleGeobinary.py](https://github.com/AlexPhysics/PythonProjects/blob/main/Geothermal%20power%20plant%20-%20binary%20cycle/cycleGeobinary.py).

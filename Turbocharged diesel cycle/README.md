# Turbocharged diesel cycle

The term turbo-diesel refers to any diesel engine equipped with a turbocharger. As with other engine types, turbocharging a diesel engine can significantly increase its efficiency and power output, especially when used in combination with an intercooler.

Diesel engines are typically well suited to turbocharging due to two factors:

1. A "lean" air–fuel ratio, caused when the turbocharger supplies excess air into the engine, is not a problem for diesel engines, because the torque control is dependent on the mass of fuel that is injected into the combustion chamber (i.e. air-fuel ratio), rather than the quantity of the air-fuel mixture.  

2. The additional quantity of air in the cylinder due to turbocharging effectively increases the compression ratio, which, in a petrol engine, can cause pre-ignition and high exhaust gas temperatures. However, in a diesel engine, fuel is not present in the combustion chamber during the compression stroke, since it is only added to the combustion chamber shortly before the piston reaches top dead center. Thus, no pre-ignition can occur.  

As per turbocharged petrol engines, an intercooler can be used to cool the intake air and therefore increase its density. @https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo-diesel

# PythonProjects
This repository presents all my work in python on different physical problems mainly concentrated on efficiency calculus on different systems.

The text is in french for each problem but the resolution is in english and somewhere in french. 

In a Project Folder you will find - the problem, the .py code with the solution; and sometimes a report and an explanation folder.

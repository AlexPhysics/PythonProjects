# PythonProjects

Welcome to my Python repository where I tackle physical problems focusing mainly on efficiency calculus for different energy systems (Geothermal power plants, ocean thermal energy plants, solar power plants, turbocharged diesel motors, etc.)

The problems and the resolution for those problems are developed in a mix of french/english languages(mostly in English).

In a Project Folder you will find - the problem, the .py code with the solution; and sometimes a report and an explanation folder (in french both) for the used system.

# PythonProjects
This repository represents my work in python on different physical problems mainly concentrated on efficiency calculus on different systems.

The problem and resolution is a mix of french/english (mostly in English)

In a Project Folder you will find - the problem, the .py code with the solution; and sometimes a report and an explanation folder.

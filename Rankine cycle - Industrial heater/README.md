# Industrial heater

In industrial applications, the Rankine cycle might be combined with an industrial heater, which could function in several ways:

1. Direct Use: Steam generated during the Rankine cycle may be tapped off before the turbine for direct heating applications in the industry, such as process heating. After releasing its heat, the steam can be returned to the cycle, often at a lower pressure, and recondensed into water. This is known as extraction steam.

2. Heat Recovery: The heat rejected by the Rankine cycle, typically in the condenser, can also be used for industrial heating applications, like water heating or pre-heating feedwater before it enters the boiler.

3. Combined Heat and Power (CHP): The Rankine cycle can be integrated into a system that generates both electricity and useful heat, optimizing overall efficiency.

4. Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC): This is a variation that uses organic fluids instead of water, which can be beneficial for capturing and utilizing low-temperature heat in industrial processes.

Integrating an industrial heater with a Rankine cycle can make the overall process more energy-efficient, as it allows the system to utilize what would otherwise be considered 'waste heat.' This is particularly beneficial in heavy industries where large amounts of heat and power are needed.

By combining power generation and heat utilization, the system can achieve higher overall thermal efficiencies, thereby reducing the total energy consumption and potentially the environmental impact.
